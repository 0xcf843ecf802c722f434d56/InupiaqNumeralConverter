# Inupiaq Numeral Converter

Tampermonkey script that converts numerals on webpages into Inupiaq Numerals.

Not intended for serious use. Messes with inputs and displays on some websites with unusable side-effects.

Requires a font to display the numerals (such as [mine](https://github.com/0xcf843ecf802c722f434d56/InupiaqNumbers)).
